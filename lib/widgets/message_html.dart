/// A message body, as HTML.
///
/// Mail is HTML, and mail HTML is a museum of it: layout tables inside layout
/// tables, inline styles, unclosed tags, quoted-printable soft breaks, and a
/// `<style>` block that contradicts all of it. Hand-writing a renderer for that
/// is a losing game — it is what this file replaces.
///
/// So this is `flutter_widget_from_html_core`, the renderer the Flutter
/// ecosystem settled on. It is the same *kind* of thing a desktop mail client
/// uses: a real HTML parser plus a CSS cascade, turned into native widgets
/// rather than into a browser. A WebView — what Gmail and Outlook put on a
/// phone — would render more of the web's CSS, and would also put a browser
/// engine, its own scrolling, its own text selection and its own layout pass in
/// the middle of a list that is supposed to feel like the rest of the app. This
/// renders in the app's own frame budget, in the app's own type, and hands
/// anything long to an isolate to parse.
///
/// What is still this app's decision, and not the renderer's:
///
/// * **Remote images are not fetched** unless the setting says so. An
///   `<img src="https://…">` is a read receipt: it tells the sender's server
///   that the message was opened, and from where.
/// * **Only `http`, `https` and `mailto` are ever handed to the platform.**
///   `javascript:`, `data:`, `file:` and arbitrary app schemes are dropped.
/// * **Links are confirmed first**, when the reader asked to be asked.
/// * Nothing here executes anything. Scripts and styles are inert: this draws.
